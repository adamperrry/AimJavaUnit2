>What things went well for you this week?

I was glad to successfully start the class and get introduced to everyone. Despite joining a group that has previously taken classes together, I was able to keep up very well, which I was initially nervous about.

The material seems very familiar so far, and I'm finding Java to be similar to VBA, syntactically. Now I just need to get better at using an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach when coding.

>What was challenging for you this week?

I think the biggest challenge when starting out any new language is getting used to the syntax. I've found that a lot of learning resources like to show the syntax first and explain it later, which I personally find frustrating. I do believe I could handle a faster pace of learning as well.

Additionally, the only OOP language I have any experience with so far is Ruby (to a small extent). It will be challenging moving from dynamic to static typing, but I do think learning a statically typed language is a great way to start off.

>How can you overcome these challenges?

To better learn syntax, I will most likely be supplementing this course with online learning resources such as Codecademy to get more practice. I have already started, and I think their curriculum will match this course's nicely. I will also try to start working on my own projects, as I definitely have more than enough free time to dedicate to it - my only problem is motivation!

I will also hopefully be reading POODR by Sandi Metz in my free time, which should apply to Java as well as Ruby.

>What was most engaging for you this week?

I think the Unit 2 homework was most engaging, as it included some aspects of the more traditional programming that I love. I think Web Development will be a great way to break into software development without a college degree, but I definitely want to focus less on the front end aspects like HTML and CSS, because "traditional programming" feels like something I will excel at. I don't know if "traditional programming" is a real term, but it feels correct for what I'm trying to get across!
